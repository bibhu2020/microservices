# React JS

    - Angular is full-featured framework. It includes a router, http client, DI, Forms, 2-way data binding and state mangement library.
    - React is unopiniated. It just gives you the tools to build UI components and leaves the rest to you. You can structure your app however you want and add other libraries as needed. Hence, react is a library.
