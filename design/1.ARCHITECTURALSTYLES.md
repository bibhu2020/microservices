# üèõÔ∏è Architectural Styles

## What Are Architectural Styles?

Architectural styles define the **structural blueprint** of a system. They dictate how components interact and where responsibilities lie. Choosing the right style can improve scalability, fault tolerance, and developer productivity. 

Let's say, You want to create an app where users can send messages to each other, see their chat history, and get notified when they have new messages.

## Common Architectural Styles (with details):

### 1. Monolithic Architecture:  
  All components are built and deployed as a single unit. Easy to develop but hard to scale and maintain as it grows.

  Example: The chat feature, user login, and notifications are all handled together in one single app.

### 2. Microservices Architecture:  
  A Microservice architecture is where an application is exposed as loosely coupled services which can independetly be developed, tested, deployed, and maintained. Each service exposed is referred as Microservices and each service performs an unique operation. Each service can have a different technology stack. 

  Example: You create separate services (or mini-apps) for chat, user management, and notifications. These services will talk to each other but work independently.

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):  
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm that focuses on producing, detecting, and reacting to events. In this model, components (or services) of a system communicate by emitting and listening for events asynchronously, rather than relying on synchronous or direct communication. **_This results in a highly decoupled system, where services are loosely connected, which can improve scalability and flexibility_**.

#### Use Case: E-commerce Order Processing System
Imagine an e-commerce platform where customers place orders, and the system needs to process those orders through multiple stages, such as payment, inventory check, shipment, and notification to the customer. This system needs to be highly scalable and responsive to real-time events, such as order placement or payment processing.

When you have too many services interacting with each other creates a complex setup. Using "Event Broker" (Azure Event Grid or Kafka) to make it simpler.

**Components**:

  1. **_Order Service_**: Receives and processes orders placed by customers.

  2. **_Payment Service_**: Handles payment processing.

  3. **_Inventory Service_**: Checks product availability and updates stock levels.

  4. **_Shipping Service_**: Manages the dispatch of products once payment is confirmed.

  5. **_Notification Service_**: Sends out email or SMS notifications to customers about their order status.

**Flow of Events**:
  1. **_Customer places an order_**:
    - The Order Service emits an OrderPlaced event. (called Topic)
    - Other services (like payment and inventory) are subscribed to this event.

  2. **_Payment Processing_**:
    - The Payment Service listens for OrderPlaced events and begins processing the payment.
    - Once the payment is confirmed, the Payment Service emits an OrderPaid event.

  3. **_Inventory Check_**:
    - The Inventory Service listens for the OrderPaid event.
    - It checks whether the ordered items are available in stock and updates the inventory.
    - If the items are available, it emits an InventoryUpdated event. If not, it emits an OutOfStock event.

  4. **_Shipping_**:
    - The Shipping Service listens for the InventoryUpdated event.
    - Once it confirms that the product is available, it starts preparing the shipment and emits a Shipped event once the package is dispatched.
    - If an issue arises, it can emit an OutOfStock or ShippingFailed event.

  5. **_Notification_**:
    - The Notification Service listens for the events such as OrderPaid, Shipped, and OutOfStock to send appropriate notifications to the customer.

**Benefits**:
  1. **_Scalability_**: As each service operates independently and is loosely coupled, it's easier to scale individual components. For example, the payment service can be scaled independently of the shipping service.

  2. **_Real-time Processing_**: Each service reacts to events in real-time, allowing the system to be responsive and immediate. For example, customers are notified of payment confirmation and shipping in near real-time.

  3. **_Resilience and Fault Tolerance_**: If one service fails, it doesn‚Äôt directly affect others. Events can be buffered, and retries can be performed until the issue is resolved.

  4. **_Loose Coupling_**: Services don‚Äôt need to know about each other‚Äôs existence; they simply react to events. This reduces dependencies and simplifies maintenance.

**Technical Components/Terms in EDA**
  1. **_Event_**: An event represents something that has happened in the system. It is a message that describes a change or an occurrence.

  2. **_Event Producer_**: An event producer is a service or component that generates and sends events. E.g. These services trigger events that are then delivered by Azure Event Grid to the relevant subscribers (consumers).

  3. **_Event Consumer_**: An event consumer is a service or component that listens to and processes events. E.g. These consumers take action based on the event they receive. For example, after consuming the OrderPlaced event, the Inventory Service will check the stock for the ordered items and reduce the stock if necessary.

  4. **_Event Stream_**: An event stream is the continuous flow of events produced and consumed by the system in real time. E.g. This allows the system to react in real-time to a series of events. For example, once the OrderPlaced event occurs, the Inventory Service can update the stock, the Payment Service can begin processing, and the Shipping Service can initiate the delivery once the payment is successful.

  5. **_Event Broker_**: An event broker is a system responsible for delivering events from producers to consumers. E.g. Azure Event Grid ensures that events are delivered to the right consumers in a highly scalable and reliable manner, enabling loosely coupled communication between services.

  6. **_Event Topic_**: A topic is a logical entity that represents a source of events. Topics are used to organize and categorize events. E.g. The produce might be producing multiple type of incidents (e.g. OrderService/OrderEvents, PaymentService/PaymentEvents, ShippingService/ShippingEvents). Topic is used to segregate them. 

  7. **_Event Subscription_**: An event subscription allows consumers to register to receive events from a specific topic or event source.

  8. **_Event Store_**: An event store is a database or storage system where events are persisted for future retrieval or replay.

  9. **_Event Filter_**: Event filtering allows you to specify which types of events a consumer should receive. This helps reduce the volume of unnecessary events.

  10. **_Event Command_**: A command is a request for a service to perform a specific action, typically causing a state change in the system.


### 4. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture:  
  System is split into layers like presentation, business logic, and data access. Enhances separation of concerns and testability.


### 5. Serverless Architecture:  
**Serverless architecture** is a cloud computing model where you build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. In this model, you don‚Äôt have to worry about provisioning, scaling, or maintaining servers. Instead, cloud providers like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud automatically manage the infrastructure for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key components and benefits of **Serverless architecture**:

1. **Key Characterstics**:

    - **_No Server Management_**: You don't need to manage or maintain servers or infrastructure. The cloud provider automatically takes care of provisioning, scaling, and managing servers.

    - **_Event Driven_**: Serverless applications are typically event-driven, meaning functions or services are triggered by events such as HTTP requests, database updates, file uploads, or messages in a queue.

    - **_Automatic Scaling_**: Serverless services automatically scale up or down based on the workload, which means you don't have to worry about scaling your application to handle increased traffic or scale it down during low usage periods.

    - **_Pay-as-you-go_**: You only pay for the actual compute resources you consume. For instance, in Azure Functions or AWS Lambda, you pay based on the number of requests and the execution time of your functions, rather than paying for idle server capacity.

    - **_Stateless_**: Serverless functions are typically stateless, meaning each request is independent, and any required state information must be managed outside the function (e.g., in a database or storage service).

    - **_Granural Execution_**: Serverless is often implemented with small units of execution (like functions), which only run when triggered. For example, Azure Functions or AWS Lambda allow you to define individual tasks or logic in response to an event.

2. **Components**:

    - **_Compute_**: This is where your business logic or processing happens, often in the form of functions.

    - **_Event Sources_**: These trigger the serverless functions and can be things like HTTP requests, file uploads, or changes in a database or Message in Azure Event Grid.

    - **_Storage and Database_**: Since serverless functions are typically stateless, you‚Äôll use cloud-based storage or databases to store state information, data, or results.

    - **_API Gateway_**: Serverless applications often expose RESTful APIs, which are routed via an API Gateway. API Gateway provides logging, routing, authentication, and rate-limiting.

3. **Benefits**:

    - **_Cost Efficiency_**: You only pay for what you use. There's no need to maintain idle servers, which leads to cost savings, especially for applications with variable or unpredictable traffic.

    - **_Scalability_**: Serverless platforms automatically scale your application based on demand, allowing you to handle large spikes in traffic without worrying about capacity planning.

    - **_Reduce Complexity_**: Since the cloud provider handles infrastructure management, server maintenance, and scaling, you can focus on writing application code and business logic, simplifying development and operations.

    - **_Faster to Market_**: With serverless, you can quickly deploy and iterate on your application since you don't have to worry about setting up or maintaining servers. This can significantly speed up development cycles.

    - **_Improved Reliability_**: Most serverless platforms come with built-in redundancy and fault tolerance, meaning your application can tolerate failures without downtime.


4. **Common UseCases**:

    - **_Web API_**: Serverless APIs that are triggered by HTTP requests

    - **_Real-time Data Processing_**: Event-driven applications that process data in real-time, such as streaming logs, data from sensors, or social media feeds. (e.g. Azure Function App reading datas from Event Grids.)

    - **_Scalability_**: Automatically trigger serverless functions to process files, such as resizing images, transcoding videos, or analyzing data uploaded to cloud storage.

    - **_Microservices_**: Each function can be a microservice that performs a specific task, and multiple functions can work together to build a complete application

    - **_Chatbots_**: Using serverless functions in response to user interactions in chat applications or voice assistants.

5. **Challenges**:
    - **_Cold Start Latency_**: When a serverless function is idle for a period of time and then triggered again, it may experience a cold start, where it takes a few extra milliseconds to initialize. 

    - **_Limited Execution Time_**: Many serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) have execution time limits (e.g., 15 minutes). If you need to run long processes, serverless may not be the right fit.

    - **_State Management_**: Since serverless functions are typically stateless, you‚Äôll need external storage solutions to maintain state, which adds complexity in some scenarios.


    - **_Debugging and Monitoring_**: Debugging serverless applications can be challenging since you don‚Äôt have direct control over the runtime environment. Cloud providers offer logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch), but the experience is not always as intuitive as with traditional server-based applications.

### 6. Data-Driven Architecture (DDA): 
DDA focuses on how data is the core driver of decisions, processes, and workflows.
  - It‚Äôs about organizing systems to collect, transform, store, and analyze data effectively.
  - Common in BI, data warehousing, AI/ML pipelines, and decision-making systems.

**Example in E-Commerce:**
  - Analyze customer purchase data ‚Üí Identify trends ‚Üí Adjust marketing strategies
  - Detect drop in product reviews ‚Üí Trigger investigation workflow

**üîß Azure tools:** Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Azure ML, Power BI

### 7. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):  
  Similar to microservices but usually used in enterprise contexts with shared data models and communication through an ESB.

### 8. Client-Server Architecture:  
  A client (e.g., browser or mobile app) makes requests to a server, which handles business logic and data.

### 9.Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture:  
  Core application logic is isolated from external concerns like databases or APIs using "ports" and "adapters".

# üåê System Design

System design is performed in combination with Architectural style. In system design, you focus on individual component and how these components communicate with each other. The objective of system design is to achieve:

- Scalability
- Availability
- Security
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Decide on Tech stack. Based on architecture style and use case (e.g., Kubernetes for microservices, Azure Functions for serverless)

In the above real-world example, you have decided on **Microservices** for the architecture style, we now need to design how all the pieces will work together. This is where System Design comes in: figuring out how everything works in detail. Let's understand the need of system design first. Then we will learn about popular system design.

## üß© Example: Components of the Chat App (System Design)

**1. User Service (User Management)**

- **_What it does_**: Manages user registration, login, and profile info.
- **_How it works_**: Stores user data (name, email, password) in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- **_Example_**: When a new user registers, this service stores their info.

**2. Chat Service (Messaging)**

- **_What it does_**: Manages sending and receiving messages between users.
- **_How it works_**: Stores messages in a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra.
- **_Example_**: When a user sends a message, it's stored and shown to the recipient.

**3. Notification Service (Alerts/Notifications)**

- **_What it does_**: Sends notifications (e.g., "You have a new message").
- **_How it works_**: Listens for updates from Chat Service and sends push/email/in-app alerts.
- **_Example_**: If User A sends a message, User B gets a push notification.

**4. Search Service (Message Search)**

- **_What it does_**: Lets users search chat history.
- **_How it works_**: Uses a search engine like Elasticsearch to index and search messages.
- **_Example_**: If a user searches for ‚Äúmeeting,‚Äù this service finds all matching messages.

### How the Components Work Together (Communication Between Services)

  **User Service ‚Üî Chat Service**
  - **_Why_**: To validate sender and receiver.
  - **_Example_**: Before storing a message, Chat Service confirms that both users exist.

  **Chat Service ‚Üî Notification Service**
  - **_Why_**: To notify the receiver of a new message.
  - **_Example_**: Chat Service sends an event to Notification Service to alert User B.

  **Chat Service ‚Üî Search Service**
  - **_Why_**: To make the message searchable.
  - **_Example_**: New message ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet tomorrow‚Äù is sent to Search Service for indexing.

### How Data Flow in the Chat App (Practical Data Flow)

  **1. User Registration**
  - User signs up.
  - **User Service** stores the data in SQL DB.

  **2. Sending a Message**
  - User A sends a message to User B.
  - **Chat Service** checks users via **User Service**.
  - Message is saved in NoSQL DB.
  - Chat Service notifies **Notification Service**.

  **3. Receiving a Message**
  - User B receives a notification.
  - Opens the app.
  - **Chat Service** fetches the message and displays it.

  **4. Searching a Message**
  - User searches ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù.
  - **Search Service** looks it up and returns the result.

### How Everything is Scaled and Managed

  **üìà Scaling**
  - If chat traffic increases, **scale only Chat Service**.
  - Other services (User, Notification) remain unaffected.

  **üí™ Fault Tolerance**
  - If Notification Service fails:
    - Messages can still be sent.
    - User B won‚Äôt be notified until the service is back up.

  **‚ö° Caching**
  - Use **Redis** to cache frequently accessed messages for faster loading.

### Summary of the Chat App Example

**üèó Architecture Style:** (Microservices)
- High-level structure.
- Split into services like:
  - User Service
  - Chat Service
  - Notification Service
  - Search Service

**‚öô System Design**
- Detailed plan of:
  - **_How data flows_**: User ‚Üí Chat ‚Üí Notification
  - **_How services communicate_**: APIs, message queues
  - **_Where data is stored_**: SQL for users, NoSQL for messages
  - **_Scalability & fault tolerance strategies_**

### üí° Final Takeaway

- **Architecture Style** = Big picture (how you break things up)
- **System Design** = Detailed map (how each part talks, stores, scales, and survives failure)

## Popular System Design Patterns

### 1. API Gateway Pattern

**What it is:**
An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It handles routing requests to the appropriate microservices and may also manage authentication, logging, rate limiting, etc.

**When to use:**
When you want to provide a unified entry point for all external clients and offload cross-cutting concerns from individual services.

**Pros:**
- **_Centralized control_**: Manages auth, logging, throttling, etc., in one place.
- **_Simplifies clients_**: Clients talk only to the API Gateway, not multiple services.

**Cons:**
- **_Single point of failure_**: If it goes down, the entire app may become unavailable.
- **_Performance overhead_**: Adds latency due to additional routing and logic.

**Example:**
In an e-commerce system, the API Gateway handles all incoming requests‚Äîlogin, browsing products, placing orders‚Äîand routes them to the appropriate services like `user-service`, `product-service`, `order-service`.

**Real-World Tool:** (Ambassador)
Ambassador is a popular **_open-source API Gateway_** built on Envoy, designed for Kubernetes environments. It supports authentication, rate limiting, observability, and more.

### 2. Service Discovery Pattern

**What it is:**
Allows microservices to dynamically discover each other using a registry.

**When to use:**
When service instances are added or removed frequently (e.g., in containerized environments).

**Pros:**
- **_Dynamic resolution_** of service locations.
- **_Easier scaling_**: Services can be added or removed on the fly.

**Cons:**
- Adds **_complexity_** by requiring service registries like Consul, Eureka, or native K8s service discovery.

**Example:**
The `chat-service` can dynamically locate `user-service` and `notification-service` using a service discovery mechanism.

### 3. Database per Service Pattern

**What it is:**
Each service owns its own database.

**When to use:**
When services need to be independent and optimized for different kinds of data operations.

**Pros:**
- **_Loose coupling_** of services.
- **_Database flexibility_**: Use SQL for one service, NoSQL for another.

**Cons:**
- **_Data consistency_** becomes harder to maintain across services.

**Example:**
In a banking system, the `account-service` uses SQL for transactions, while `reporting-service` uses NoSQL for fast read access.

### 4. Event Sourcing Pattern

**What it is:**
Stores state changes as a sequence of events instead of the current state.

**When to use:**
When an audit trail or full event history is important.

**Pros:**
- **_Traceability_** and **_replayability_** of system changes.
- Scales well for **_event-driven systems_**.

**Cons:**
- **_High complexity_** in design and event versioning.
- Can result in **_eventual consistency_**.

**Example:**
Every order placed, updated, or cancelled in an online shop is recorded as an immutable event.


### 5. Saga Pattern (for Distributed Transactions)

**What it is:**
Splits a transaction into smaller steps handled by individual services, with compensating actions in case of failure.

**When to use:**
When updating data across multiple services that each have their own database.

**Pros:**
- Enables **_eventual consistency_** without 2-phase commit.
- Fault isolation: One service‚Äôs failure doesn‚Äôt block the others.

**Cons:**
- **_Requires compensating logic_** for rollbacks.
- May introduce **_latency and complexity_**.

**Example:**
For a travel booking app, if flight booking fails, it triggers a compensating action to cancel the hotel reservation.


### 6. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**What it is:**
Separates the read and write operations into different models.

**When to use:**
When you want to scale and optimize reads and writes independently.

**Pros:**
- **_Optimized performance_** for each operation.
- Enables **_separate data models_** for complex domains.

**Cons:**
- **_Increased complexity_** managing sync between models.
- **_Eventual consistency_** between read and write data.

**Example:**
In an e-commerce system, order placement and order viewing are handled by separate services/models.

### 7. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**What it is:**
Prevents repeated calls to failing services by "opening" the circuit after a threshold of failures.

**When to use:**
To avoid cascading failures in microservices.

**Pros:**
- **_Improves resilience_** and helps detect downstream failures early.
- **_Avoids flooding_** of failing services.

**Cons:**
- Needs **_fine-tuning thresholds_** and recovery logic.

**Example:**
If `payment-service` fails, `checkout-service` stops calling it temporarily and shows fallback messaging.

### 8. Retry Pattern

**What it is:**
Retries a failed operation after a delay, often using exponential backoff.

**When to use:**
When failures are expected to be **_temporary or intermittent_**, like network glitches.

**Pros:**
- **_Improves reliability_** for transient faults.

**Cons:**
- May **_increase response time_** or cause **_overload_** if misconfigured.

**Example:**
If message delivery fails due to timeout, the system retries 3 times with increasing delays.

### 9. Dependency Injection (DI) Pattern

**What it is:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to achieve loose coupling between components. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, those dependencies are injected from the outside. This makes the code easier to test, extend, and maintain.

Example: You have a class A that intantiates Class C (this is inheritted from B) within it. 

**When to use:**
When failures are expected to be **_temporary or intermittent_**, like network glitches.

**Pros:**
- **_Improves reliability_** for transient faults.

**Cons:**
- May **_increase response time_** or cause **_overload_** if misconfigured.

**Example:**
If message delivery fails due to timeout, the system retries 3 times with increasing delays.

### üîö Conclusion

After choosing a **_Microservices_** architecture, these **_system design patterns_** help define how your services will interact, recover from failure, scale, and maintain data consistency.

**_Ambassador_** is a real-world implementation of the **_API Gateway Pattern_**, especially effective for Kubernetes-based microservices setups.

Each pattern comes with **_trade-offs_**, so the right mix depends on your system‚Äôs goals and scale.

# üß© Code Design Patterns

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are time-tested solutions to common programming problems. They're not code templates but best practices that can be applied to improve the design and maintainability of your code.

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. Used in logging, configuration, or caching.

- **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class. Enables loose coupling.

- **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related objects without specifying concrete classes. Often used in UI toolkits.

- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step-by-step. Useful when you want to construct different representations of the same object.

- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing one. Effective for performance when object creation is expensive.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Translates one interface into another, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.

- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to individual objects without altering their class. Common in UI frameworks.

- **Facade**: Simplifies a complex subsystem by providing a unified interface.

- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly. Good for hierarchical structures like file systems.

- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object (e.g., lazy loading, access control).

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer**: Allows objects to be notified when the state of another object changes. Ideal for event systems and UI bindings.

- **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Used for sorting, compression, etc.

- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing undo/redo and logging capabilities.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain until one handles it. Useful in middleware pipelines.

- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

- **Mediator**: Centralizes communication between objects to reduce tight coupling.

- **Visitor**: Adds new behaviors to object structures without modifying the objects.

- **Template Method**: Defines the program skeleton in a base class but allows subclasses to override steps.

# üîß Key Concepts in Practice

## üîÅ Webhook

A webhook is a software architecture approach where an application (or service) sends a notification to another application when a specific event occurs. It's essentially **_a reverse API, meaning the receiving application doesn't need to actively poll or request data; instead, it's pushed to it when an event happens._**

In a WebAPI, a client (browser) pulls the information from the server or the asks the server to performn some action. In a Webhook, a server notifies another server or app about an event.

A webhook simply requires setting up a single POST request on the sending end, establishing a URL on the receiving end to accept the data, then performing some action on the data once it is received.

Key Components of a Webhook:
  - Event Trigger: Action/Event in the source application.
  - Payload: Data associated with an Event.
  - Callback URL: An endpoint in the target application to receive the payload.

- **Use Case**: Payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) notify you when a transaction completes.
- **Where It Fits**: Event-driven integration between systems.

## üîå WebSocket

A WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables persistent, bidirectional communication between a client (like a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It differs from traditional HTTP, which is typically unidirectional (client requests, server responds) and requires a new connection for each interaction.

- **Use Case**: Chat applications, live dashboards like stock data, collaborative tools.
- **Where It Fits**: Real-time applications that need low-latency updates.

## üßÆ Rate Limiter

Controls the number of requests a client can make to protect the system from abuse or overload.

- **Use Case**: APIs limiting users to 1000 requests/hour.
- **Where It Fits**: API gateway, authentication layer, resilience patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Idempotency

In the context of microservices, this means that a request to a microservice endpoint, even if sent multiple times due to retries or network issues, will produce the same result as the first time it was sent. It would not duplicate the transaction.

- **Use Case**: Prevents duplicate orders when a user retries a request.
- **Where It Fits**: APIs, microservices, distributed systems, retries.

# üìê Complementary DevOps Principles and Practicates

## What is DevOps?
A software during its life goes through multiple delivery cycles deliverying features, and improvement. Each delivery cycle goes through ideation, requirements, implementation, testing, building/packaging, deploying, and monitoring. This is continious delivery process and this continous delivery process warrant improvements to make the software move faster into the market. This improvement is what is acheived through DevOps. **Devops makes release process faster**.

## Challenges that DevOps Solves

  **1. Miscommunication and Lack of Collaboration**:
  Development team does coding, and the operation is responsible for deploying and operating them. The application team does not consider where the application gets deployed, and the opearation does not know how the app/code works. This gaps lead to failure of deploying application smoothly and stretches the release period. 

  In traidtional way, it requires the release process to go through a regorious review process with checklists and documentations which delays the code release.

  **2. Conflict of Interest**:
  Development and Operation have different incentives. The Development team wants to push the feature fast, and the operation wants to protect the environment from instability. The opration resists the speed of release, and checks that it is 100% safe. 

  **3. Security**:
  Secure SDLC is a practice these days. Objective is to ensure the code is non-vulnerable, and has no security concern. In traditional way, the manual review process slows down the release process.

  **4. Application Testing**:
  Testing the app on different levels (feature testing, end-to-end testing, testing in different environments, performance testing) delays deployment.

  **5. Manual Deployment**:
  Releasing code into production is manual. It involves environment provisioning, building container, running scripts, and deploying the code into multiple servers, and validate.

  It is slow, and error-prone because of lacking app knowledge with operation, and documentations.

## Benefit of DevOps
Devops is a combinations of cultural Philosphies, Practices, and Tools. It creates the process of releaseing the software fast and with high quality.

# üìê Complementary SRE Principles and Practicates

## What is SRE?
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is the traditional IT job in DevOps. SRE spends 50% of time resolving customer issues, peforming first level of analysis, 24x7 on-call, and handling escalations. Another 50% of time, the SRE spends on automation and monitoring (logs & metrics). 

- SRE contiously feed data into the Development team on how improvise product, and customer expriences.

### Alerting vs Monitoring

- Alerting is about drawing attention to an anticipated failure. E.g. high CPU utilization anticipates a future failure and notifies for attention from the SRE.

- Logging is needed for studying unanticipated failures which would help in performing RCA, and building alerts for future anticipation.
