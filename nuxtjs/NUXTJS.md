# What is NuxtJS?
Nuxt is a framework built on Vuejs. It comes with some added features that Vue alone does not have:
- SSR (Server Side Rendering) 
- In SSR, the initial page rendering takes place from the server. The server sends the HTML and JS bundle to the website. And then the subsquent content updates on the page takes places like a SPA. (e.g. )
- SSR makes SEO better, faster browser loading and still gives the benefits of an SPA.
- folder-based routing

Note: SPA is good in some situation, but not recommended where SEO plays a major role in promoting websites. SPA website has nothing much on the page for the search engine to crawl.
